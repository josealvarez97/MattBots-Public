# 1. Overview and relevant links.

MattBots is one of the ventures that best represents my skills. However, it is a personal venture for which I'm not willing to share the full source code. This repository highlights the main features, explains the design of the app, among other relevant things that allow to understand (and prove) the result of my work.

P.S. The fact that I don't plan to post the full source code here doesn't mean that I won't be happy to walk you around any specific technical aspect of the app [*if you reach out*](mailto:j.alvarez@minerva.kgi.edu) - even the full source code!

**My role:** I'm the chief programmer of **Tec√∫nTecs**, a group of young creators - that I started - currently developing [MattBots](http://www.tecuntecs.com), a Game-Based Learning app that will aim to stimulate Early Childhood Mathematical Thinking. 

**The team:** To learn more about the team, visit [http://www.tecuntecs.com/#team](http://www.tecuntecs.com/#team)

The app is currently in a state of development, but a **demo can be tried out here**: 
* [Windows ZIP DEMO VERSION (90 mb)](https://storage.googleapis.com/www.tecuntecs.com/mattbots-builds/MattBots-ByTecunTecs.zip)
* [Android APK DEMO VERSION (85 mb)](https://storage.googleapis.com/www.tecuntecs.com/mattbots-builds/MattBots-ByTecunTecs.apk)
*  iPhone beta versions will be available after we raise enough funds.

# 2. Summary

**MattBots is** an application that *improves* the early childhood mathematical thinking of children through game-based learning, and *reveals* insights on children's abilities by tracking the player's actions within the game and performing learning analytics to all the data generated during game time - **giving a chance to offer valuable feedback and advice to parents.**

As Early Childhood Mathematical Thinking is a broad concept - you can find what MattBots focuses on in the [MattBots Competency Model](http://www.tecuntecs.com/mattbots-competency-model.html), which refers to the collection of knowledge, skills, and attributes to be stimulated and assessed of the player.

### More on how the app looks so far?

**Colorful comis will tell Matt's adventures**

Such as that time when Matt played a dance battle against that jealous robot and defeated it.
![](https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/022/413/667/44d70e3e873811e179e25464ba39b7f0_original.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&w=680&fit=max&v=1535792397&auto=format&gif-q=50&lossless=true&s=3e26520c6771b82ecc9001c5e82b3b65)

Or that time he got lost in a Mars-like dessert and saw himself in need of building a bridge to cross over a cliff - all because the other jealous robot threw his ship there.

Immersing children in engaging and exciting experiences is a core part of MattBots. That's why we put time and effort in crafting every stage of the game.
